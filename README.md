# Operating-Platforms

The Gaming Room created a gaming application named “Draw It or Lose It” designed to display images relevant to a specific puzzle, while separate teams compete to solve said puzzle. After initial success with the game on Android systems, The Gaming Room desired to expand their product to multiple platforms for the most compatibility and exposure possible. 

This software design document effectively evaluates the similarities and advantages between leading operating systems. It provides information regarding the memory and storage management options, security, and servers and cloud platforms. It then offers recommendations on what would work best for their application. For this application, it was important to evaluate the user needs in terms of speed of the application and mimicking the previously successful Android application for usability. 

I approached this project expecting for aspects of it to change with the development of new information and client request. In this agile perspective, I was able to adjust the scope of my recommendations accordingly and ultimately offered the most useful information possible.
